confluence-vagrant-install
===================

A project that uses Vagrant and Puppet to create and boot a VirtualBox VM and then to download and install a copy of Confluence 5.1.  This project is very closely based off of Nicola Paolucci's Stash provisioning example https://bitbucket.org/durdn/stash-vagrant-install.git
